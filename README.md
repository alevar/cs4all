# CS4ALL - An experimental course to introduce folks to the fundamentals of CS using free and open-source tools and materials.

The primary objective behind the first iteration of the course is to engage those who have time available during the times of the global pandemic to learn new widely thought-after skills in basic coding, scripting, data analysis and visualization. The course assumes no prior experience and all are welcome to join this experiment!

Another goal set out by this project is to build a teaching workflow utilizing only a set of online resources which:
1. require no software installation
2. are not limited by a specific platform
3. can all be accessed online free of charge
4. are versatile enough to facilitate development of sophisticated projects and use in most applicable jobs

A lot of the syllabus and schedule for the first iteration of the course will be designed as the course progresses depending on the specific requirements, abilities and prior experience.

Here's a brief list of the topics I am hoping to cover in this course:
1. Python syntax
2. Using Python to parse structured and semi-structured data. Writing small scripts and tools to automate specific tasks.
3. Working with structured data using IPython notebooks and pandas
4. Visualizing results using matplotlib and seaborn
5. Develop understanding of debugging principles and gain familiarity with the online community
